This is very useful when you need to join two topics that are out of sync, i.e when data in a topic may be produced _before_ you receive join information in the other topic. In the documentation, however, it is not specified that the value of _max.task.idle.ms_ *must* be lower than _max.poll.intervall.ms_, otherwise you'll incur into an endless rebalancing problem. I think it is better to clearly state this in the documentation.\"\n"," b'Currently we close the stream thread in the following way:0. Commit all tasks.1. Close producer.2. Close consumer.3. Close restore consumer.4. For each task, close its topology processors one-by-one following the topology order by calling {{processor.close()}}.5. For each task, close its state manager as well as flushing and closing all its associated state stores.We choose to close the producer / consumer clients before shutting down the tasks because we need to make sure all sent records has been acked so that we have the right log-end-offset when closing the store and checkpointing the offset of the changelog. However there is also an issue with this ordering, in which users choose to write more records in their {{processor.close()}} calls, this will cause RTE since the producers has already been closed, and no changelog records will be able to write.Thinking about this issue, a more appropriate ordering will be:1. For each task, close their topology processors following the topology order by calling {{processor.close()}}.2. For each task, commit its state by calling {{task.commit()}}. At this time all sent records should be acked since {{producer.flush()}} is called.3. For each task, close their {{ProcessorStateManager}}.4.

The choice of the absolute/relative offset for the inner messages will also be based on the topic message format version.For example, if there is an old compressed message set with magic=0 in the log and the topic is configured for magic=1, then after cleaning, the new message set will have a wrapper with magic=1, the nested messages will still have magic=0, but the message offsets will be relative. If this happens, there does not seem to be an easy way to recover without manually fixing up the log.The offsets still work correctly as both the clients and broker use the outer message format version to decide if the relative offset needs to be converted to an absolute offset.

See the docs: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#kafka_streams_thread_monitoring There\\'s some surprising ambiguity in these definitions that has led to Streams actually reporting something different than what most people would probably expect. Specifically, it\\'s not defined what a \"process call\" is. A reasonable definition of a \"process call\" is processing a record or processing a task (both of which are publicly facing concepts, and both of which are the same, since tasks process records one at a time). However, we currently measure number of invocations to a private, internal `process()` method, which would actually process more than one record at a time. Thus, the current metric is under-counting the throughput, in an esoteric and confusing way. Instead, we should simply change the rate and total metrics to measure the (rate and total) of _record_ processing.'\n"," b'Store iterators should be closed in all/most of the cases, but currently it is not consistently reflected in the documentation and javadocs.

This can result in deadlocks in a couple of scenarios if a log entry from the producer network thread is also at a log level that results in the entry being appended to a Kafka topic. 1. Producer's network thread will attempt to send data to a Kafka topic and this is unsafe since producer.send may block waiting for metadata, causing a deadlock since the thread will not process the metadata request/response. 2. KafkaLog4jAppender#append is invoked while holding the lock of the logger. So the thread waiting for metadata in the initial send will be holding the logger lock. If the producer network thread has.a log entry that needs to be appended, it will attempt to acquire the logger lock and deadlock. This was probably the case right from the beginning when KafkaLog4jAppender was introduced, but did not cause any issues so far since there were only debug log entries in that path which were not logged to a Kafka topic by any of the tests. A recent info level log entry introduced by the commit https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/a3aea3cf4dbedb293f2d7859e0298bebc8e2185f is causing system test failures in log4j_appender_test.py due to the deadlock. The asynchronous append case can be fixed by moving all send operations to a separate thread. But KafkaLog4jAppender also has a syncSend option which blocks append while holding the logger lock until the send completes.

Every so often one of the StreamThreads (ie a single Consumer instance) would appear to permanently fall out of the group, as evidenced by a monotonically increasing _last-rebalance-seconds-ago._ We inject artificial network failures every few hours at most, so the group rebalances quite often. But the one consumer never rejoins, with no other symptoms (besides a slight drop in throughput since the remaining threads had to take over this member\\'s work). We\\'re confident that the problem exists in the client layer, since the logs confirmed that the unhealthy consumer was still calling poll. It was also calling Consumer#committed in its main poll loop, which was consistently failing with a TimeoutException. When I attached a remote debugger to an instance experiencing this issue, the network client\\'s connection to the group coordinator (the one that uses MAX_VALUE - node.id as the coordinator id) was in the DISCONNECTED state. But for some reason it never tried to re-establish this connection, although it did successfully connect to that same broker through the \"normal\" connection (ie the one that juts uses node.id). The tl;dr is that the AbstractCoordinator\\'s FindCoordinatorRequest has failed (presumably due to a disconnect), but the _findCoordinatorFuture_ is non-null so a new request is never sent. This shouldn\\'t be possible since the FindCoordinatorResponseHandler is supposed to clear the _findCoordinatorFuture_ when the future is completed. But somehow that didn\\'t happen, so the consumer continues to assume there\\'s still a FindCoordinator request in flight and never even notices that it\\'s dropped out of the group. These are the only confirmed findings so far, however we have some guesses which I\\'ll leave in the comments.

In other words, from consumer client\\'s pov nothing is owned after unsubscribe, but from the user caller\\'s pov the partitions are not revoked yet. For callers like Kafka Streams which rely on the rebalance listener to maintain their internal state, this leads to inconsistent state management and failure cases. Before KIP-429 this issue is hidden away since every time the consumer re-joins the group later, it would still revoke everything anyways regardless of the passed-in parameters of the rebalance listener; with KIP-429 this is easier to reproduce now.

This we we are guaranteed that the streams\\' tasks are all closed as revoked by then. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 [Optimization] If the generation is reset due to fatal error from join / hb response etc, then we know that all partitions are lost, and we should not trigger `onPartitionRevoked`, but instead just `onPartitionsLost` inside `onLeavePrepare`.'\n"," b'The Kafka consumer should have metrics around the number of seconds spent in rebalance over the last minute as well as the number of rebalances started during the previous minute.The other important thing about these metrics is that they should only be updated once per minute for example the rebalance time should not increase from second to second during a rebalance.'\n"," b'Cf KIP-233'\n"," b\"In the DSL, Kafka Streams applies an optimization for non-materialized tables: when these are queried an upstream state store is accessed. To ensure that the correct value is returned from the lookup, all intermediate processors after the materialized store, and before the processor that triggers the lookup are re-applied (cf `KTableValueGetter`). For re-applying DSL operators like filter/mapValues that works fine. However, for transformValue(), the method is executed with the incorrect `RecordContext` (note that DSL operators like filter don't have access to the `RecordContext` and thus, are not subject to this bug). Instead of using the record context from the value that was received from the upstream state store (and that is re-processed), the transformer would see the context from the record that triggered the lookup.

This code seems to work so this is not pressing, just a simplification.'\n"," b\"Currently in the Raft's leader implementation, we validate that follower fetch offsets increase monotonically. This protects the guarantees that Raft provides since a non-monotonic update means that the follower has lost committed data, which may or may not result in data loss. It depends whether the update also causes a non-monotonic update to the high watermark. If the fetch is from an observer, no harm done since observers do not affect the high watermark. If the fetch is from a voter and a majority of nodes (excluding the fetcher) have offsets larger than or equal to the high watermark, also no harm done. It's easy to check for these cases and log a warning instead of raising an error. The question then is what to do if we get a voter fetch which does cause the high watermark to regress? The problem is that there are some scenarios where data loss might be unavoidable. For example, a follower's disk might become corrupt and ultimately get replaced. Often the damage is already done by the time we get the Fetch request with the non-monotonic offset, so the stricter validation in fact just prevents recovery. It's worth noting also that the stricter validation by the leader cannot be relied on to detect data loss. It could be the case that a recovered voter restarts in the middle of an election. There is no general way that I'm aware of that lets us detect when a voter has lost previously committed data. With all of this mind, my conclusion is that it makes sense to loosen the validation in fetches. The leader can still ensure that its high watermark does not go backwards and we can still log a warning, but it should not prevent replicas from catching up after hard failures with disk state loss.\"\n"," b\"Currently exactly-once producer is coupled with individual input partitions.
